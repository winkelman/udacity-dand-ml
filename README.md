# Machine Learning

This is the fourth project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree and accompanies the [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) course from Udacity.  In this project we build an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

If you wish to recreate the model building process as well as model validation, the full Enron dataset must be copied from the [UD120 course repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects).  Once this is complete navigate to the `tools` directory and run `startup.py` in order to unpack the full email corpus.  Finally, all the project files from this repository should be copied to the `final_project` folder of the UD120 copy.  Then `poi_id.py` can be run to simulate the model building process, and `tester.py` can be run to generate additional evaluation metrics.

To see a demo without unpacking the full email corpus, you can copy the `demo` branch of my repository and run `poi_id.py`.  It has a fraction of the email corpus and the evaluation scores will be different from those in the final report.

A pdf of the project report can be found above as well as a simulated output of the results in 'jupyter_notebook.ipynb'
